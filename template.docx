- Brief description of feature extraction technique proposed in paper




- Scale invariance of technique “Consistency of performance of models trained on extracted features over scale variation”


- Orientation invariance “Consistency of performance of models trained on extracted features over orientation invariance”


- Lighting robustness 
	“Consistency of performance of models trained on extracted features over lighting variation”


- Temporal permanence 
	“Consistency of performance of models trained on extracted features over time”


- Use of local/global features 
	“Specify whether local or global features are used. Both used is preferred”

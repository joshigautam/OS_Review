Bimodal face + lip verification
SVM trained on geometrical features (global features of lip) + SVM trained on local features of face(found using Discriminative common vector [DCV] and Discrete Wavelet Feature Transform [DWT])
The use of two SVMs means the classification process is probably quiet slow
